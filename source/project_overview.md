# Overview

The objective of this project is to develop an automated Python-based solution for generating correlation and process capability (Cpk) reports. This tool is designed to provide an efficient, on-demand analysis platform for evaluating test performance and ensuring adherence to quality standards in the semiconductor industry. There are two inputs that will use in this program which are

1. **Units Datalog for Each Board**  
   - Contains detailed measurement data for each tested unit.  
   - Used to compute statistical metrics such as mean, standard deviation, mean shift, and standard deviation ratio.  

2. **Limit Board File**  
   - Defines acceptable thresholds for each test parameter.  
   - Enables the calculation of process capability metrics (Cp and Cpk) for evaluating performance across test boards.  

By automating the analysis process, the project aims to enhance productivity, improve accuracy, and reduce manual intervention in critical quality assurance workflows.
